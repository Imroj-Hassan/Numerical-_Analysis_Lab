# Task_201_2nd_task:

Gauss elimination method is used to solve a system of linear equations. A system of linear equations is a group of linear equations with various unknown factors. As we know, unknown factors exist in multiple equations. Solving a system involves finding the value for the unknown factors to verify all the equations that make up the system.
